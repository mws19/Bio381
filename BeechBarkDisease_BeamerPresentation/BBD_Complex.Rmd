##Host 
American beech (*Fagus grandifolia*; Fagaceae): a common nut-producing hardwood tree distributed across North America.   

- Prominent member of northern hardwood forest in northeastern North America.   
- Characteristic smooth grey bark   
- Ovate, acuminate leaves, with distinct  veins each ending in a single tooth.    
- Fruit is a bur which contains two nuts.

##Pathogen
The group of pathogens includes two scale insects which facilitate the disease, and two ascomycete fungi which are the primary causal agents. 

- __Scale insects (order Hemiptera)__:    
    - *Cryptococcus fagisuga*: invasive to N. America   
    - *Xylococcus betulae*: native to N. America   
- __Perithecial ascomycete fungi__:    
    - *Neonectria ditissima*   
    - *Neonectria faginata*   

##Beech Bark Disease - Classic Model
*Cryptococcus fagisuga* creates wounds in the beech bark which are invaded by *Neonectria* spores 

- Scale insects weaken the tree, but the tree is not killed until after infection by Neonectria. 
- Depending on the presence of Neonectria in the area, several years may elapse between when the tree is attacked by insects and when it is infected by fungi. 


##Beech Bark Disease Development
Forests infected with the BBD complex exist in different stages of disease development:

- **Advancing Front**: Trees infested by scale insects but not yet by Neonectria
- **Killing Front**: Both scale insects and *Neonectria spp.* abundant, severe tree mortality
- **Aftermath Forest**: Forests after the first wave of beech death. Characterized by small population of scale insects and small percentage of living beech trees,  most highly diseased. Roots of dying trees often form dense thickets of sprouts, which are highly vulnerable to the disease.


##Beech Bark Disease - New Model

The process of infection  differs depending on whether the forest has previously been infected.
    - In killing front forests, disease progress follows the classic model   
    - In aftermath forests, the disease progress follows a more complicated new model   

- __New Model__: Takes into account several additional factors which  predispose beech trees to infection by *Neonectria*  spp:   
    - Bark damage by *Xylococcus betulae* in addition to the invasive scale insect.    
    - Nutritional stress, especially low levels of phosphorus   
    - Importance of particular plant phenolic compounds (isorhamnetin and catechin) to susceptibility by different scale insects

##Disease Significance

- Beech nuts are an important food source for many animals living in Northern Hardwood Forests, including birds (such as ruffed grouse) and mammals (such as squirrels, bear, deer, and many others).
- Beech bark disease has resulted in abrupt decline of this staple food in many affected natural communities, causing increased ecosystem vulnerability.
