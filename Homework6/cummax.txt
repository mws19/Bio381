### `cummax`    
#### Morgan W. Southgate

The function cummax returns a vector whose elements are the cumulative maxima of the elements in the argument as read from L to R. 

cummax(x)

Input:     
    - x: a numeric or complex object
    
Output:     
    - an atomic vector whose elements are the cumulative maxima of the elements in the argument as processed from L to R. Processing from L to R, the function consecutively finds the largest number. If the number in position x+1 is larger than the number in position x, its numeric value becomes the next element in the vector. If the number in position x+1 is smaller than the number in position x, the numeric value of x becomes the next element in the vector. 
    

```{r}
# Create a list d by concatenating sequences 1:3, 0:2, and 2:4
d <- c(1:3, 0:2, 2:4)

# View list d
print(d)

# Find the cumulative maxima of the list
cummax(d)

```
