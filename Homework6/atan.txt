### `atan`
#### Morgan W. Southgate

The atan function is the inverse of the tan function, and so returns the y value for which x= tan(y). 

atan(x)

Input:     
    - x: numeric or complex vector signifying angle theta.
    
Output:     
    - the y value for which x = tan(y), in terms of radians. 

```{r}
# Calculates the value of y for which 5 = tan(y)
atan(5)

```
