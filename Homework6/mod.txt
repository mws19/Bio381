### `%%`
#### Morgan W. Southgate

The %% function is an arithmetic operator function which gives the modulus of two arguments. This modulus operator divides the x argument by the y argument, rounds down to the nearest integer, and then finds the remainder between the (integer value * y) and the value of x. For vectors x & y where x is an integer multiple of y, the result of x mod y is 0. 

x%%y

Input:    
    - x,y: numeric or complex vectors or objects which can be coerced to this type
    
Output:    
    - the difference between x and the rounded integer quotient of x/y

```{r}
# Assign integer values to the vectors x & y
x <- 15
y <- 4

# Find the difference between the value of x and the value of the rounded integer quotient x/y. 15/4 = 3.75, rounded down to 3. Then 3*4 = 12, and 15-12 =3. 
x%%y

# When y is an integer multiple of x, x%%y = 0
12%%4

```
