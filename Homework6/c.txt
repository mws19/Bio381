### `c`
#### Morgan W. Southgate

The c function concatenates values into a vector or a list. All arguments are coerced to a common type in the order logical -> integer -> double -> character.Logical arguments are coerced to integer arguments using the system TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0.  

c(....)

Inputs:    
    - ....: the objects to be concatenated

Output:     
    - an atomic vector or list of concatenated objects

```{r}
# Concatenate the numeric variables 1 & 2 and the logical variable TRUE
c1 <- c(1,2,TRUE)

# Check the structure of c1 - as two different types of variables were concatened, the logical variable should have been coerced into a numeric variable of the value 1. 
str(c1)
```
