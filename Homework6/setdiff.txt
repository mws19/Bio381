### `setdiff`
#### Morgan W. Southgate

The setdiff function is a set function which compares two sets of values and returns the values which are in the first set but NOT in the second set. Therefore, setdiff(x, y) returns a different output than setdiff(y, x). 

setdiff(x, y)

Input:    
    - x, y: vectors (of the same mode) containing a sequence of items with no duplicate           values.     
Output:     
    - The values in the first set of values which are NOT in the second set of values.    
    
```{r}
# Create two sets of values set1 and set2 with overlapping but distinct values
set1 <- c( "a","b","d","e")
set2 <- c( "a","c","d","f")

# Use the setdiff function to return the values which are unique to set1
setdiff(set1,set2)

# See that the output is changed by reversing the order of sets 1 and 2
setdiff(set2,set1)

```
